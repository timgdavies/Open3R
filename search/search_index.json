An open data standard is a set of rules that describe the structure and components of an open data set. By putting these rule in place, it means that people and organisations who are publishing data about the same thing, can use the same language to talk about the thing. This means that someone can read about the standard, and then use the data that is published to that standard. It makes it a lot easier to reuse data that has been published, and is especially useful for using data that is published by lots of different people, to make a bigger dataset with more coverage. What is the HWRC open data standard? This household waste recycling centre (HWRC) open data standard is a standard which describes information about HWRCs, and is being designed to provide guidance to local authorities on publishing data about HWRCs. Data such as opening times, the services that are offered by a HWRC A data standard makes data better for users, because it means that different publishers, with different data capture and publishing systems, can publish data in the same format. This means it is much easier to stick two publisher's datasets together. If everyone publishes their data to the standard, then it is theoretically possible to have a dataset that covers the whole of the UK. This dataset could then be used to power a Where's My Nearest Recycling Centre app, or support time-to-travel analyses for recycling centres. The standard is being developed according to the Open Stand principles of: Due process Broad consensus Transparency Balance Openness How is the standard being developed? Funded by the Open Data Institute, workshops with industry experts, developed over a few iterations. How to use the standard The documentation here provides the detail of how to publish data to the standard, and how to use data that has been published to the standard. At a very high level, the publishing flow is as follows: A local authority decides they want to publish HWRC data to the standard They populate the csv template provide here (or prepare one from scratch using the specified column names) They create a csv file or spatial file of areas served by each HWRC. 4a. They publish the csv file(s) and/or spatial files on their website OR 4b. They send the data to the custodian of the standard for publishing Let the custodian of the standard know that there is new data Then repeat these steps whenever there is a change to the data.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1_Introduction/1_1_Introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1_Introduction/1_1_Introduction/#what-is-an-open-data-standard","text":"An open data standard is a set of rules that describe the structure and components of an open data set.

Each local authority area has a legal responsibility to provide this service to residents, and the service is usually provided in multiple sites across the local authority area. HWRCs might be known by different names in different areas, or by different people. Some examples of this are: civic amenity (CA) sites community recycling centres (CRCs) [remove?] household-waste and recycling centres (HWRCs) household-waste sorting sites (HWSSs) household recycling centres (HRCs) household re-use and recycling centres (HRRCs) household-waste recovery centres (HWRCs) re-use and recycling centres (RRCs) recycling and waste centres (RWCs) tips dumps Owner The owner of a HWRC is usually the Local Authority that the site is located within. Owners have a legal responsibility to provide household recycling services to its residents. Operators The operator of a HWRC is the organisation responsible for the day-to-day management of the site. This could be the local authority, a different local authority, another not-for-profit organisation, or a private company. Services offered Services offered by HWRCs will differ across sites. Some may offer electrical item recycling, for example, while others may not. It's important for residents to know which services are offered by HWRCs in their local area, so that they can visit the correct one depending on the material they have to recycle. Area served Each HWRC has a specific catchment area - and only residents who live within that catchment area are permitted to use the facility. Usually these catchment areas are as simple as a local authority, or a collection of local authorities, but there are circumstances where residents from a particular part of one local authority are permitted to use a HWRC in a neighbouring local authority.","title":"Key Concepts"},{"location":"2_Key_Concepts/2_1_Key_Concepts/#key-concepts","text":"","title":"Key Concepts"},{"location":"2_Key_Concepts/2_1_Key_Concepts/#household-waste","text":"Household waste is waste that is generated by a household","title":"Household waste"},{"location":"2_Key_Concepts/2_1_Key_Concepts/#household-waste-recycling-centres","text":"A HWRC is a staffed household waste recycling centre, and is a place where residents can take household waste to be recycled, treated or disposed of.

In a database it may be recorded as 'Woodhouse Ln Rec Ctre'. While these all talk about the same thing, it could be hard for a human to know that they are the same, and pretty much impossible for a computer. To help get around this, we use identifiers. These are codes that we use to unambiguously reference a particular thing in our database. These identifiers must be unique, and to make sure of this, there are a few tricks we can use when deciding on an identifier. The main one is, wherever possible, to use an identifier from another source. An example of this would be for operators of HWRCs, who are companies, and therefore have entries in the Companies House database. By using the Companies House identifier for these operators, we can be certain the code is unique, and we know that we can join together different local authorities datasets to analyse which companies operate sites across the country. A bonus here is that usine the Companies House ID means an analyst can access additional information about the operator using the Companies House API, such as the date that the company was incorporated, or its filing history.

The local authority list should be drawn from the list of Local Authorites in the UK, provided in the controlled lists section of this documentation. 2. HWRC Area Served Each HWRC has an area that it serves. This means that only people who live in the specified area can use the HWRC. Many of these areas are aligned with Local Authority boundaries, but some are more complex than that. Information about areas served will need to be published as a separate file. This can be either as a CSV file, or a spatial file, such as geojson. 3. Services This list is a list of materials accepted by the HWRC. This list is quite high-level, to accommodate the nuances of waste management. This will allow residents to make informaed choices about where they take their waste. 4.
